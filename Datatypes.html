        <h2>Basic datatypes in javascript</h2>
    </head>
    <body>
            <p>In programming, data types is an important concept.
            To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know
            something about datatypes.Data types basically specify what 
            kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
            There are seven basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided
            into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), 
            and special data types.<br><b>String, Number, and Boolean</b> are primitive 
            data types.<b>Object and Array</b> are composite data types. Whereas
            <b>Undefined and Null</b> are special data types.
            <h3>1.The String Data Type</h3>
            The String data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters).
            Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.<br>
            <b>For Example:</b>
            var a = 'Hi there!';<br>
            Output: Hi there!
            <h3>2.The Number Data Type</h3>
            The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without
            decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation<br>
            <b>For Example:</b>
            var a = 25.05;<br>
            Output: 25<br>
            alert(18/9);<br>
            Output: 2<br>
            alert(19/0);<br>
            Output: Infinity<br>
            alert("Hello"/7);<br>
            Output: NaN
            <h3>3.The Boolean Data Type</h3>
            The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.
            It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false) etc.
            <br><b>For Example:</b>
            var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;<br>
            alert(b > a)<br> 
            Output: true<br>
            alert(b > c)<br>
            Output: false
            <h3>4.The Object Data Type</h3>
            The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.<br>
            <b>For Example:</b> 
            var car = {modal: "BMW X3",color: "white",doors: 5}<br>
            Output: {modal: "BMW X3", color: "white", doors: 5}
            <h3>5.The Array Data Type</h3>
            An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.
            Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index,
            and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects,
            and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0.<br>
            <b>For Example:</b> 
            var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];<br>
            var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];<br>
            alert(colors[0]);<br>
            Output: Red<br>
            alert(cities[2]);<br>
            Output: New York
            <h3>6.The Undefined Data Type</h3>
            The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined.
            If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.<br>
            <b>For Example:</b>
            var a;<br>
            alert(a)<br> 
            Output: undefined
            <h3>7.The Null Data Type</h3>
            This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value.
            A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("")
            or 0, it is simply nothing.<br>
            <b>For Example:</b>
            var a= Null;<br>
            alert(a)<br> 
            Output: Null
