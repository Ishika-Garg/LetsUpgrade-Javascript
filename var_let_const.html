            <h3>1.On the basis of its scope or availability</h3>
            <b>(I) VAR-</b> Var declarations are globally scoped which means that any variable
            that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>var a=20;<br>
            console.log(a);<br>
            <script>var a=20;
                console.log(a);</script>
            Note: Press F12 for showing the output.<br>
            here in the console we get an output as 20.<br>
            <b>(II) LET-</b> Let declarations are locally scoped which means that variable declared in
            a block with the let is only available for use within that block.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>let greeting = "say Hi";<br>
            if (times > 3) {<br>
                 let hello = "say Hello instead";<br>
                 console.log(hello);//"say Hello instead"<br>
             }
            console.log(hello)<br>
            <script>let greeting = "say Hi";
                    let times=4;
                    if (times > 3) {
                     let hello = "say Hello instead";
                     console.log(hello);//"say Hello instead"
                     }
                    console.log(hello)</script>
            Output: hello is not defined<br>
            we see that using hello outside its block(the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error.
            This is because let variables are block scoped.<br>
            <b>(III) CONST-</b> Similar to let, Let declarations are also locally scoped.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>const greeting = "say Hi";<br>
            if (times > 3) {<br>
                 const hello = "say Hello instead";<br>
                 console.log(hello);//"say Hello instead"<br>
             }
            console.log(hello)<br>
            <script>const greeting = "say Hi";
                    const times=4;
                    if (times > 3) {
                     const hello = "say Hello instead";
                     console.log(hello);//"say Hello instead"
                     }
                    console.log(hello)</script>
            Output: hello is not defined<br>
            so it shows that it is similar output that of let.
            <h3>2.On the basis of its updation and redeclaration property</h3>
            <b>(I) VAR-</b> The var variables can be updated and redeclared within its scope.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>var greeter = "hey hi";<br>
            var greeter = "say Hello instead";<br>
            console.log(greeter);<br>
            <script>var greeter = "hey hi";
                var greeter = "say Hello instead";
                console.log(greeter);</script>
            Output: say hello instead (Here the variable greeter is updated and redeclared)<br>
            <b>(II) LET-</b> The var variables can be updated but not redeclared.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>let greeting = "say Hi";<br>
                               let greeting = "say Hello instead";<br>
                               console.log(greeting);<br>
                               <script>let greeting = "say Hi";
                                       let greeting = "say Hello instead";
                                       console.log(greeting)</script>
                               Output: error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared.<br>
            <b>(III) CONST-</b> The var variables cannot be updated or even redeclared.<br>
            <b>For example:</b>const greeting = "say Hi";<br>
            greeting = "say Hello instead";<br>
            console.log(greeting);<br>
            <script>const greeting = "say Hi";
                    greeting = "say Hello instead";
                    console.log(greeting);</script>
            Output: error : Assignment to constant variable. <br>
            Output: error : Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared.
